# Autism-Prediction-ML-Project
A Machine Learning project to predict Autism using supervised learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction using a dataset of behavioral and demographic factors.

# Autism Prediction ML Project

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of Autism based on demographic and behavioral data. Using machine learning algorithms, the project processes input data, trains a predictive model, and evaluates its performance.

## Dataset
- **File:** train.csv
- **Description:** Contains behavioral and demographic features used for Autism prediction.

## Project Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Machine Learning Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Prediction on new input data

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

## Installation & Usage
